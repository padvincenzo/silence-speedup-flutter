# Silence SpeedUp

![Logo](assets/icons/icon.png)

**Silence SpeedUp** shortens videos by finding the silent stretches and either
speeding them up or cutting them out. FFmpeg does the encoding; this app decides
what to ask it for.

Made for lectures, interviews, podcasts and tutorials — anything where the
speaker pauses a lot or talks slowly.

This is the **Flutter rewrite** of the Electron app at
[padvincenzo/silence-speedup](https://github.com/padvincenzo/silence-speedup).

---

## Why the rewrite

The Electron version worked, but it asked the user to go and find `ffmpeg.exe`
before it would do anything, and it refused to run until they had. That is a bad
first five minutes.

Here **FFmpeg is bundled**. There is no path to configure, no binary to
download, no preference to get wrong. The plugin that provides it
([`ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new`](https://pub.dev/packages/ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new),
full-GPL, includes `libx264`) also covers Android, iOS, macOS and Linux behind
the same API — so the same processing pipeline can follow the app to a phone
later. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

Along the way, several bugs in the original were fixed rather than reproduced —
the silence margin was applied unevenly, muting a silence desynced the audio,
and the exporter could overwrite the source file. Each is listed with its
reasoning in [docs/porting-notes.md](docs/porting-notes.md).

---

## Status

**Pre-release (0.9.x).** The processing pipeline and the desktop UI are complete
and the Windows build works. Held below 1.0 until the demo player from the
Electron version is ported — see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

Primary target is **Windows**. macOS and Linux should build from source; they are
not yet tested. Android is scaffolded but has no UI.

---

## Getting started

1. Launch the app.
2. Add your videos — **Add video(s)**, a folder, or drag them onto the window.
3. Adjust the settings if you want to (the defaults are sensible).
4. Press the play button on a row to hear a **short preview sample** first, then
   press **Start**.

Results land next to the original videos by default; the export folder sits on
the main window, not behind a menu.

Full walkthrough of every setting: [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).

## Features

- 🎙️ **Silence detection you can tune** — noise floor, minimum pause length,
  and a margin so words are not clipped
- ⏩ **Speed up or remove** the silences, and optionally mute them
- 🗣️ **Speed up the speech too**, if you want the whole thing faster
- 🎧 **Multi-track audio** — carry every audio track through while detecting the
  pauses from the first one, which is what an OBS capture with voice on track 1
  and system audio on track 2 needs
- ▶️ **Preview before you commit** — encode a short sample through the real
  pipeline and hear the result, without waiting for the whole file
- 🔍 **Or just measure** — a detection-only pass reports how much of a file is
  silence in seconds rather than minutes
- 📁 **The export folder is where you need it** — on the main window, editable
  in place, defaulting to the source video's own folder
- 📋 **Batch processing** with a queue, a live log and an interruptible run
- 🎛️ **Encoder controls** — CRF, frame rate, x264 preset and tune, audio rate,
  output container
- 🪟 **Compact progress mode** — a slim always-on-top strip for long batches
- 🧭 **Material interface** — a navigation drawer, encoding settings that
  dock beside the queue on a wide window, and an app settings page that
  explains each option in place, rather than a menu bar and a modal
- 🌗 **Light, dark or system theme**
- 🌍 **English and Italian**, following the system language by default
- 📦 **FFmpeg included** — nothing to install

## Requirements

Nothing, for a packaged build: FFmpeg ships with the app. Windows 10 or newer,
64-bit.

### Building from source

Flutter 3.47+ and, on Windows, Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ desktop
workload — see [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/padvincenzo/silence-speedup-flutter
cd silence-speedup-flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
```

### Packaging the installer

Additionally [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php):

```powershell
winget install --id JRSoftware.InnoSetup --source winget
.\installer\build-installer.ps1
```

The result is `dist\SilenceSpeedUp-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe`.

## Contributing

Welcome, in any of these forms:

- Reporting bugs
- Translating the app (copy `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`, change `@@locale`, and
  run `flutter gen-l10n`; the new language appears in the menu on its own)
- Suggesting or implementing features from [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- [Buying me a coffee](https://paypal.me/VincenzoPadula)

Before a pull request: `flutter analyze` clean, `flutter test` green, and any
change to the FFmpeg calls covered by a test in
[test/fragment_planner_test.dart](test/fragment_planner_test.dart) or
[test/preview_and_audio_test.dart](test/preview_and_audio_test.dart).
