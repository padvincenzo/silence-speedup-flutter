# Roadmap

What is not built yet, roughly in the order it is worth building.

The Flutter port reproduces the Electron app's processing pipeline and its
desktop UI. The items below are the gaps, plus the directions the rewrite was
arranged to make possible.

---

## 1. Demo player

**The one feature from the Electron app that is not ported.**

The original had a per-file *demo* button: it ran the detection pass, then opened
a [video.js](https://videojs.com/) window with the
[`videojs-silence-speedup`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/videojs-silence-speedup)
plugin, which played the file live — jumping the playback rate up during the
detected silences and back down for speech. It let you *hear* your settings
before spending twenty minutes encoding.

In the port, its role is partly covered by the per-row **Measure the silences
without exporting** action, which reports the percentage of silence found in
seconds. That answers "are my thresholds sane"; it does not answer "does this
sound right".

### What it needs

Desktop video playback with a controllable playback rate.
[`media_kit`](https://pub.dev/packages/media_kit) is the realistic option:
`video_player` has no first-class Windows support, and `media_kit` exposes
`setRate` plus reliable position events, which is exactly the pair required.

### Sketch

```dart
// The detection pass already yields List<SilenceRange> on the entry.
// Playback then only has to switch rate at the boundaries:
player.stream.position.listen((Duration position) {
  final bool inSilence = ranges.any((SilenceRange r) =>
      position.inMilliseconds / 1000 >= r.start &&
      position.inMilliseconds / 1000 < r.end);
  final double target = inSilence
      ? settings.silenceSpeed.factor
      : settings.playbackSpeed.factor;
  if (target != currentRate) player.setRate(target);
});
```

The pieces it can reuse: `SilenceRange` and the detection pass as they are, and
`SpeedOption.factor`, which already carries the numeric rate for exactly this
kind of use.

### Open questions

- **Removed silences.** When the silence speed is Remove, should the player seek
  past them, or play them at some high rate as a preview? Seeking is truer to
  the output but makes the preview jumpy.
- **Muting.** `volume=0` on silences would need to be mirrored by muting the
  player at the boundaries.
- **Weight.** `media_kit` pulls in native libmpv per platform, on top of the
  FFmpeg the app already bundles. Worth measuring the size cost before
  committing.

### Cost

The largest item on this list: a new window/route, a new native dependency, and
rate-switching that has to be smooth enough to be useful. Do not start it
without agreeing the scope first.

## 2. Android

The FFmpeg layer already runs there: `ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new` supports Android,
and the whole pipeline — engine, planner, models — is platform-agnostic behind
the `FFmpegRunner` interface. The `android/` directory is scaffolded and the app
compiles for it; what is missing is everything around the pipeline.

What has to change:

- **`AppPaths`.** `~/speededup` means nothing on Android. Output has to go
  through the MediaStore or a user-granted tree URI, and scratch space belongs in
  the app's cache directory.
- **Import.** No drag-and-drop and no arbitrary filesystem browsing; needs the
  document picker, and `ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new` can take SAF URIs directly.
- **UI.** The menu bar, resizable window and compact always-on-top strip are all
  desktop affordances. A phone wants a bottom sheet for settings and a single
  scrolling queue.
- **Long runs.** Encoding video on a phone takes minutes and the OS will not
  leave the app in the foreground. Needs a foreground service and a progress
  notification.
- **Defaults.** `medium` preset and CRF 23 are desktop numbers. A phone needs
  faster presets and probably hardware encoding.

Worth doing after the desktop app has settled, since it will exercise the same
pipeline.

## 3. Desktop polish carried over from Electron

Small, self-contained, each independently useful.

- **Taskbar progress.** The original called `win.setProgressBar`. On Windows
  this needs the `ITaskbarList3` COM API — the
  [`windows_taskbar`](https://pub.dev/packages/windows_taskbar) package covers
  it, guarded by `Platform.isWindows`.
- **Completion notification.** The original raised a system notification when a
  batch finished. `local_notifier` or `flutter_local_notifications`.
- **Remember window geometry.** Size and position across restarts;
  `window_manager` already exposes what is needed.

---

## 4. Queue and workflow

Things the Electron app never had, that a batch tool wants.

- **Reorder the queue**, by drag or by buttons.
- **Per-file settings.** One noise preset for the whole batch is wrong when the
  files come from different rooms. Would mean moving `ProcessingSettings` from
  the store onto the entry, with the store holding the default.
- **Presets.** Named setting bundles — "lecture", "podcast", "screencast" —
  since the useful combinations are few and stable.
- **Retry a failed file** without re-adding it.
- **Recurse into subfolders** when importing a directory. Currently only files
  directly inside it are taken.
- **Estimated time remaining.** The encoder reports its speed; with the total
  duration known this is a straightforward projection, and it is the single most
  requested thing in a tool where a run takes twenty minutes.

---

## 5. Pipeline

- **Hardware encoding.** `h264_nvenc`, `h264_qsv`, `h264_amf` would cut encode
  time dramatically. Requires probing which encoders the bundled build actually
  supports at runtime, and a fallback when the chosen one fails — the codec is
  currently fixed at `libx264` precisely because the concat step needs every
  fragment to match.
- **Fewer fragments.** Each fragment is a separate FFmpeg process. A long file
  with many pauses spends real time on process startup alone. A single
  `filter_complex` with `trim`/`atrim` and `concat` could do it in one pass —
  faster and seam-free, at the cost of a much more complex filter graph and
  coarser progress reporting. The biggest available performance win.
- **Waveform preview** of the detected silences, so the settings can be judged
  visually rather than by percentage.
- **Audio-only inputs.** MP3, WAV, M4A. The pipeline assumes a video stream in
  several places (`-c:v`, the `fps` filter); audio-only would need a parallel
  argument path.

---

## 6. Testing and CI

- **Widget tests** for the settings sheet and the queue.
- **Engine tests with a fake `FFmpegRunner`.** The interface exists for this;
  what is missing is the fixture. It would cover sequencing, cancellation and
  the failure paths, which unit tests on the planner cannot reach.
- **GitHub Actions**: `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` on every push, and a
  Windows release build on tags.

---

## Not planned

- **A configurable FFmpeg path.** Removing it was the point of the rewrite.
- **Web.** FFmpeg-kit does not target it, and the app is fundamentally about
  writing files to a folder.
- **Cloud or GPU-farm processing.** Out of scope for a local desktop tool.
